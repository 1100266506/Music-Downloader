The following package includes execute.java, MusicDownload.py, and song_list.txt. 
These files together are a javaFX application that takes song search inputs and downloads youtube
songs of those searches. The application stores youtube song downloads as mp3 files in a folder
that can be modified to the user. 

Must use from the command line
First, change the path of the harddrive by typing 
	"export PATH=$PATH:/home/benjamin/CS/java_project"
Then compile and run execute.java file to launch the javaFX application
